# Price Prediction-Mumabi -Property

This project involves the development of a property price prediction model aimed at estimating property values in Mumbai. The model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict property prices based on various features.

Key Features:
Data Collection: The model uses historical data on property prices, including factors such as location, size, amenities, and more.

Preprocessing: The data undergoes thorough preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Feature Engineering: Relevant features are engineered to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. This includes the creation of new variables and the selection of important attributes.

Model Training: Multiple machine learning algorithms are employed, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to train the model and achieve optimal performance.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

Visualization: The project includes visualizations of the data and model predictions using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
